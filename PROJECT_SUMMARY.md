# ha-webrtc-sip-card Project Summary

## Overview
A modern WebRTC SIP client card for Home Assistant that enables video calling functionality with proper media stream handling, call state management, and UI controls.

## Key Components

### 1. SIP Manager (`sip-manager.ts`)
- Handles SIP.js library integration and WebSocket connections
- Manages SIP registration, connection, and call handling
- Implements media stream management for audio/video
- Provides event-based communication with other components

### 2. Call Manager (`call-manager.ts`)
- Manages call states (incoming, outgoing, connected, ended)
- Handles contact management and caller ID lookup
- Implements call timer functionality
- Provides call control methods (answer, reject, hangup, mute, hold)

### 3. WebRTC SIP Card (`card.ts`)
- Main UI component that integrates with Home Assistant
- Renders the complete user interface with LitElement
- Handles user interactions and displays call state
- Manages video elements for local and remote video

### 4. Editor (`editor.ts`)
- Configuration editor for the card in Home Assistant
- Allows users to configure SIP settings and contacts
- Provides form fields for all configurable options

### 5. Utilities (`utils.ts`)
- Configuration merging and validation
- Duration formatting and phone number formatting
- Ringtone playback utilities
- Extension sanitization functions

### 6. Types (`types.ts`)
- TypeScript interfaces for strong typing
- Defines SIPCardConfig, SIPContact, CallState, etc.

### 7. Constants (`constants.ts`)
- Default configuration values
- DTMF key definitions
- Version information

### 8. Styles (`styles.ts`)
- Shared CSS styles using LitElement's css tagged template
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Features Implemented

### Core SIP Functionality
- ✅ SIP registration and connection management
- ✅ WebSocket connection handling with secure/unsecure support
- ✅ Lazy loading of SIP.js library for better performance
- ✅ Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

### Call Management
- ✅ Incoming and outgoing call handling
- ✅ Audio and video call support
- ✅ Call state tracking (ringing, answered, held, ended)
- ✅ Call duration timer
- ✅ Auto-rejection of unanswered calls
- ✅ DTMF support for keypad input

### Media Handling
- ✅ Local and remote audio stream management
- ✅ Local and remote video stream management
- ✅ Camera/microphone resource cleanup after calls
- ✅ Video transmission control (enable/disable)
- ✅ Autoplay restriction handling
- ✅ Media stream replacement during calls

### UI/UX Features
- ✅ Responsive design for different screen sizes
- ✅ Contact quick dial functionality
- ✅ Manual dial pad with numeric input
- ✅ Call status indicators
- ✅ Video status indicators
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Configuration validation with detailed error messages

### Home Assistant Integration
- ✅ Custom card registration with Home Assistant
- ✅ Lovelace card editor support
- ✅ Type-safe configuration handling
- ✅ Event-driven architecture for state updates

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Media Stream Handling Errors
- Fixed "play() request was interrupted" errors by implementing proper error handling
- Added retry mechanisms for video playback failures
- Implemented stream reattachment for autoplay restrictions

### 2. Resource Management
- Ensured camera and microphone are properly released after calls
- Added cleanup for media tracks when calls end
- Implemented proper disconnection handling

### 3. UI Responsiveness
- Separated call timer updates from full state re-renders for better performance
- Added debouncing for video state updates
- Implemented efficient state management

### 4. Call Control Issues
- Prevented multiple simultaneous answer calls
- Fixed call timer not updating properly
- Added cancel call button during ringing state
- Separated mute and camera controls

## Technical Architecture

### Event-Driven Design
The project uses an event-driven architecture where:
- SIP Manager emits events for SIP-level changes
- Call Manager listens to SIP events and manages call state
- Card Component listens to Call Manager events and updates UI

### Media Stream Management
- Uses proper MediaStream handling with getUserMedia
- Implements track replacement for dynamic video enabling/disabling
- Handles autoplay restrictions gracefully with retry mechanisms
- Provides separate video elements for local and remote streams

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation when features fail
- User-friendly error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of SIP.js library
- Debounced UI updates to prevent excessive re-renders
- Efficient state management with minimal updates
- Cleanup of unused resources

## Configuration Options

The card supports extensive configuration including:
- SIP server URL and credentials
- Domain and display name settings
- WebSocket port and security settings
- STUN/TURN server configuration
- Contact list with names, extensions, and icons
- Video and audio settings
- Debug mode for troubleshooting

## Build System
- Uses Vite for development and production builds
